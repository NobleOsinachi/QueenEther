QueenEther (QuEth) is an ERC20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to provide the basic implementation of an ERC-20 standard.

## Features

- **Standard Compatibility:** QueenEther follows the ERC20 standard, ensuring interoperability with other Ethereum-based projects and services.

- **Decentralized:** Being deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, QueenEther benefits from the security and decentralization of the Ethereum network.

To interact with the QueenEther token, you can use Ethereum wallets that support ERC20 tokens, such as MetaMask. Below are some sample instructions to get started:

1. Install MetaMask (if not already installed) and create an Ethereum wallet.
